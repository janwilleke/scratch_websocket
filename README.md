# scratch_websocket
websocket access for scratch 3.0

## What is it:
Its a simple javascript file adding a web-socket extention to scratch. This way its possible to interact with web-socket anywhere on the world and especiliy on the localhost.

## Motivation:

Lots of extention use web sockets but always in a covered custum way, the url can not be choosen, json format is been send...
Here the connection can be choosen and if json should be send it can be build in scratch ;-)
